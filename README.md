# Qstake: Universal Staking Platform Proposal  
## Create, Manage, and Trade Staking Pools for Any Token  

---

## 1. Introduction  

This proposal outlines the development of a **universal staking platform** on Qubic where **any token** (e.g., QXMR, Garth, Matilda, or future community tokens) can be staked through customizable smart contracts.  

The platform empowers **pool creators** to launch staking pools with flexible terms, while **stakers** can participate by locking tokens and earning rewards. A built-in **marketplace** allows stakers to **buy and sell staked positions** without unstaking, adding liquidity and flexibility to long-term commitments.  

**Funding Request:** $18,000 USD (9.5B Qu @ 0.0000019)  
**Destination Wallet:** `GBBDPCKSUDPTAFOIROJCFPRLEPXBJSTMKFONPDVBHBWTPUDVFEKRYPSBLLIA`

## 2. Key Features  

- **Multi-Token Staking Pools**  
  - Any Qubic-based token can be staked.  
  - Pool creators define reward parameters, durations, and rules.  

- **Deflationary Mechanics (Optional)**  
  - Pool creators can enable burns of staking/reward tokens to drive scarcity.  

- **Marketplace for Staked Positions**  
  - Staked positions become tradable assets.  
  - Buyers can acquire locked positions (with time left) at negotiated prices.  
  - Sellers can exit early without unstaking.  

- **Shareholder Rewards & Charity (Optional Modules)**  
  - Pools can allocate % of rewards to shareholders or to real-world causes.  

- **Transparent Reward Distribution**  
  - Rewards paid in Qubic or in the pool’s base token.  
  - Fair, proportional payouts based on stake size and duration.  

- **Dashboard & Analytics**  
  - Real-time visibility into stake performance, lock history, and APY.

## 3. Business Model  

Staking has become a cornerstone of DeFi ecosystems. However, most platforms are token-specific and lack flexibility. This proposal expands the concept:  

- **For Users:** Anyone can stake tokens to earn rewards without specialized hardware or mining setups.  
- **For Pool Creators:** Teams and projects can bootstrap token ecosystems by creating custom staking pools.  
- **For Traders:** The marketplace lets participants **buy/sell locked positions** (secondary market) while they remain staked — similar to tokenized certificates of deposit.  

This makes staking more accessible, liquid, and community-driven.  

- **Pool Fees:** 
- 3% Shareholders
- 1% Dev team

- **Optional Pool Fees:** Each pool creator will have the ability to create up to three customized fee options
- Possible Examples:
- 2% Burn (optional)
- 1% Charity (optional)
- 1% Team (optional)

## 4. Components to Be Developed  

### Frontend UI  
- Unified dashboard for all token pools.  
- Create/manage staking pools (for pool creators).  
- Lock/unlock forms for stakers.  
- Marketplace for buying/selling staked positions.  
- WalletConnect integration.  
- Hosted at **[https://www.qstake.org](https://68e01deb3b1df70082fe7731--qstake.netlify.app)** LIVE DEMO

### Smart Contracts  
- **Pool Factory:** Deploy new staking pools for any token.  
- **Staking Logic:** Lock tokens, calculate rewards, distribute fairly.  
- **Marketplace Logic:** Enable secondary market trading of staked positions.  
- **Optional Modules:** Burn-to-boost APY, charity donations, shareholder dividends.

## 5. Technical Architecture  

- **Smart Contracts:** Qubic C++  
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + Qubic Connect  
- **Backend Services:** Lightweight APIs for indexing, analytics, and marketplace data.

## 6. User Journey  

### A. Pool Creator  
1. Connect wallet.  
2. Launch a new staking pool (define token, duration options, reward mechanics, optional fees).  
3. Pool becomes visible in the global dashboard.  

### B. Staker  
1. Connect wallet
2. Browse active pools.
3. Stake tokens by selecting amount and lock period.  
4. View live analytics: rewards, APY, burn boosts.  
5. (Optional) Burn tokens to boost APY.  

### C. Marketplace Trader  
1. Connect wallet
2. Browse listed staked positions in the marketplace.
3. Purchase locked positions (inherits remaining time and reward stream).  
4. Sellers gain liquidity without penalty, buyers acquire discounted yield positions.
